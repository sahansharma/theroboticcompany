# Robotics Engineering Standards

- ISO 10218: Safety requirements for industrial robots and robot systems.
- ROS (Robot Operating System): Open-source framework for robot software development.
- IEEE 1872: Ontologies for robotics and automation.
- PID Control: Proportional-Integral-Derivative control is a fundamental feedback control strategy in robotics.
- Kinematics: Forward and inverse kinematics are essential for robot arm motion planning.
- Sensor Fusion: Combining data from multiple sensors (e.g., IMU, LIDAR, cameras) for robust perception.
- Actuators: Common types include servo motors, stepper motors, and linear actuators.
- Embedded Systems: Microcontrollers (e.g., STM32, Arduino, Raspberry Pi) are widely used in robotics.
- Communication Protocols: CAN, I2C, SPI, UART are standard for robot subsystems.
- Safety: Emergency stop, interlocks, and redundancy are critical in industrial robotics.
